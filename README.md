The app was built using the best practices of React and TypeScript. There are 7 cities to choose from. There is a custom built Select Box and a custom built Toggle Button where a user can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. No State Management Tool was used (No Redux or Context API). Sass was used for styling. Axios library was used to fetch the data. The weather favicon was set for a better experience.
The weather data is fetched dynamically from OpenWeatherApi, including the weather icon (that is why it is so ugly).
